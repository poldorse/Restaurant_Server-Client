# Restaurant_Server-Client

This practice consists of the programming of three processes data, server and client in UNIX programming. This practice consisted in the realization of a chain of restaurants, where the data process was registrating the server processes that were connecting and then assigning each client that wanted to connect to a server (restaurant).

# What I learned

  •  Full development of back-end project.
  •  Interconnecting server, client and data. For this reason, concepts such as threads, sockets, semaphores, files, etc. were touched.
  •  Unix programming with basic commands with C.
